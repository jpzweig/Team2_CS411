# Team2_CS411
Project for CS411 Team 2 -- Spring 2018

Team Assignment 1: Pitches

PROJECT IDEA 1:
  Our first idea for a project would be a web app that uses API's from facebook, instagram, and google maps. This website would feature a search bar where you type in a location where you want to travel to, and our program would search through the people you follow and connect you with someone who has been to that location (within a certain radius). The user then has the option to connect to this person using the information that is public on social media.

-> ask about linking cheap flights or yelp to this idea?

PROJECT IDEA 2:
  Taking a user's favorite artits from Spotify, we generate a list of those artists' live concert videos from Youtube. We plan to use Node.js, angular, express, and mongoDB. First, the user will authenticate through Spotify and then their top artists will be stored, displayed, and then a "playlist" (list of live concert videos) will be generated from youtube based on these artists and diplsayed back to the user on the front end.
