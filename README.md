# Team2_CS411
Project for CS411 Team 2 -- Spring 2018

PROJECT IDEA 1:
  Our first idea for a project would be a web app that uses API's from facebook, instagram, and google maps. This website would feature a search bar where you type in a location where you want to travel to, and our program would search through the people you follow and connect you with someone who has been to that location (within a certain radius). The user then has the option to connect to this person using the information that is public on social media.

-> ask about linking cheap flights or yelp to this idea?

PROJECT IDEA 2:
  Based on spotify API and most played artists, recommends concert tickets in your area, and then, using the songkick and ticketmaster and stubhub APIs, we can store the prices in the database and find the cheapest price for the concert that is recommended to you.
