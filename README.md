# Team2_CS411
Project for CS411 Team 2 -- Spring 2018

PROJECT IDEA 1:
  Our first idea for a project would be a web app that uses API's from facebook, instagram, and google maps. This website would feature a search bar where you type in a location where you want to travel to, and our program would search through the people you follow and connect you with someone who has been to that location (within a certain radius). The user then has the option to connect to this person using the information that is public on social media.

-> ask about linking cheap flights or yelp to this idea?

PROJECT IDEA 2:
  Based on spotify API and most played artists, recommends a youtube playlist generated through Mongo. The playlist will be stored and displayed through the user. We plan to use Node.js, angular, express, and mongoDB. First user withh authenticate through spotify and then the top artists will be stored, displayed, and then a playlist will be generated from youtube based on these artists and diplsayed back to the user on the front end.
