Story 1: Generate Playlist via Spotify PLaylist
  Background:
  - I want to make a playlist on YouTube based on songs that I put in a playlist on Spotify so that I can see live performances. Thankfully, Spotify stores your playlists and allows access to them via the API call.
  Log In:
  - I first must log in by authenticating my Spotify profile, which will be requested right when I access the web application.
  Playlist Generate:
  - After I authenticate through Spotify, the back end will get to work by pulling/displaying playlists on Spotify and then using the songs and artists in the playlists to pull live performances from YouTube.
  Results:
  - The playlist will then be displayed for the user in the page below.
