Story 1: When All Goes Right
  Background:
  - I want to make a playlist on YouTube based on what artists I listen to most often and most recently. Thankfully, Spotify stores your "Top Artists" based on these two features.
  Log In:
  - I first must log in by authenticating my Spotify profile, which will be requested right when I access the web application.
  Playlist Generate:
  - After I authenticate through Spotify, the back end will get to work by pulling/displaying top artists and then using the top artists to generate a playlist on Youtube.
  Results:
  - The playlist will then be displayed for the user as well as the top artists from spotifty.
