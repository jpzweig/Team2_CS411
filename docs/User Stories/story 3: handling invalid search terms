Story 3: handling invalid search terms
As a user, I want to receive alternative suggestions for a search term that is spelt wrongly, or doesn't exist, or doesn't return any results. This is so that I know what went wrong if I don't get the results I'm looking for. 

1) Misspelt place/city name
	- Return a list of location/city names closest to the search term
2) Search term does not exist as a name of a place/city in the world
	- Return a list of location/city names closest to the search term; OR 
	- Return "No such place exists, please enter a valid location." 
3) None of the user's followers or followees have been to the place being searched
	- Return "No one you follow/who follows you have been to the place you specified, but you may want to check out the following photos and hashtags related to your destination!"; AND
	- Return a page of public photos with the location tag of the search term, and a list of hashtags that either most frequently show up in these pictures, or often co-occur with the hashtag of the search term.
