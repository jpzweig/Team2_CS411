Why we chose MEAN stack: 
- MEAN uses JSON all the way, which matches the data responses we receive from the APIs we're using. This makes it convenient to pass data between layers of the stack.
- MongoDB, being a non-relational database, fits our needs, as we're not storing much relational/duplicate information.
- We felt that coding in JavaScript from front to back end will provide flexibility and convenience. 
- All of us wanted to learn more JavaScript.
