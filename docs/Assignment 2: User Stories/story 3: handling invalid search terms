Story 3: Generating YouTube playlist if the artists have no live videos uploaded.

1) Generate a playlist using a Spotify playlis
	- Return a list of top-viewed matches which will be generate from the artist name + live + performance.
	- If the artist does not have live videos, the top video will still be pulled from this criteria
	- This happens because we are unable to know if the artist being showed in the YouTube embedded video is actually who they say they are.
