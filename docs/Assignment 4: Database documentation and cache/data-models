Our mongoDB Schema: 
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  address: Array,
  accessToken: String,
  accessed: Integer
}

The required fields are email and address (favorite artists) and accessToken.
we make the search by querying a logged in user's email and then using its save artists. 

we're going to use accessed (it saves a timestamp) as the cache to check how long ago we've curated a youtube playlist for
the logged user.
